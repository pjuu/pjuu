Description:
    Alert base classes and managers

    To see how alerts are displayed to the user, see users.backend.get_alerts
    and users.views.alerts.

    For an example of how alerts are used look in users.backend and
    posts.backend. Posts especially as this exdends the alert object for its
    own purposes.
