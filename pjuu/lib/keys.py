# This is to define the patterns for all the keys used inside Redis
# This is best method I can think of to stop the DUPLICATION of strings
# around the code base

# Usage example:
#
#   USER_FEED.format('aaebdfeb479c11e4ad966003089579ee')
#
# Will return the user identified by hex uuid repr

# User related keys

# Returns: list

# Returns: zset
USER_FOLLOWERS = "{{user:{0}}}:followers"

# Returns: zset
USER_FOLLOWING = "{{user:{0}}}:following"

# Returns: zset
USER_APPROVED = "{{user:{0}}}:approved"

# Returns: zset
USER_ALERTS = "{{user:{0}}}:alerts"

# Post related keys

# Returns: zset

# Return: hash

# Authentication tokens

# Uses around the site to discover valid tip name
